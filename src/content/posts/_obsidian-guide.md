## Overview

All plugins, key bindings, and the theme can be customized to your liking, but this is what's on by default.

## Philosophy 

1. Minimalism first. 
2. Emphasis on focus and keeping things distraction-free. 
3. Little-to-no clickable UI elements - reliance on keyboard shortcuts instead.

## Theme

Fittingly, the [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/home) theme is used. It uses an understated color scheme with high contract options and a focus mode that helps immerse you in your content. 

The [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) and [Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) community plugins are also installed by default, giving you complete control over your experience. 

## CSS Snippets

A custom CSS snippet called `custom-draggable-top-area.css` is active so moving your window is easier when the window frame is hidden and there's no tab bar. 

## Important Hotkeys

Because Obsidian's interface has been stripped down to its bare essence, relying on hotkeys is imperative. Here's a guide:
- Open settings: `CTRL + ,`
- Command palette: `CTRL + P`
- Search vault: `CTRL + O`
- Open a new tab: `CTRL + T`
- Close current tab: `CTRL + W`
- Toggle left side panel: `CTRL + ALT + Z`
- Toggle right side panel: `CTRL + ALT + X`
- Toggle tab bar: `CTRL + ALT + S`
- Open homepage: `CTRL + M` 

If you're on Mac, `CTRL` = `CMD`.

## Plugins 

Disabled default core plugins: 
- Backlinks
- Canvas
- Daily Notes

Community plugins used: 
- Astro Composer
- Default New Tab Page
- Disable Tabs
- Hider
- Homepage
- Minimal Theme Settings
- Paste image rename

### Homepage and Default New Tab Page

Both of these work together so you're default screen is a `.base` file that's a directory of all of your blog posts, listed in reverse-chronological order. You're able to customize the note properties in the views to your liking. 

### Minimal Theme Settings, Disable Tabs, and Hider

As mentioned earlier, these plugins keep you focused and distraction-free while allowing for customization of your experience.

### Paste Image Rename 

Quickly drag and drop image files or paste directly from your clipboard and give them proper, SEO-ready names. 

### Disable Tabs

This effectively makes it so opening any new tab replaces the current one only. Especially nice for when you're hiding the tab bar and don't want multiple tabs.
