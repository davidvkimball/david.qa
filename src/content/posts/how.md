Using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), mostly. Specifically with the [Chiri theme](https://github.com/the3ash/astro-chiri).

I host this website publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidvkimball/david.qa) and deploy the site with [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). 

I plan on making a video soon that documents the whole process, because it's easily repeatable and very fun.
