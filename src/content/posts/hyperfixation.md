How do you set [constraints](/constraints/) on your hyperfixations? What's going "too far"?

Entering flow state is addictive and highly engaging. Where do taking breaks come in? What if you're just one break away from breaking your flow? 

Pomodoro technique is supposed to help with this. I wonder if it's worth trying.
